## üîß Development preferences 

- Main languages:
  - Rust - the language that I want to work with right now. I like its features, proc macros, and memory management.
  - C/C++ - my first language from the university. I like its low-level stuff.
  - Golang - goroutines are a fantastic feature and a perfect fit for writing asynchronous code.
- Second languages:
  - Javescript/Nodejs - every project that I worked on somehow required the usage of JS.
  - Swift/Objective-C - in my free time, I like to develop some applications on my smartphone.
  - C#/Java - studied in the university and after interacting with it on different works.
  - Haxe - it is an unusual language, but I used it for around two years together with C++.
  - Python - in the university, I played with machine learning, and I have basic knowledge of that language.
- OS:
  - Mac OS - last 2 years I'm using that system as main.
  - Linux - it was the primary system for development before Mac OS. I worked with Ubuntu image and tried Debian and other distributives in most cases.
  - Windows - used that system for development at the beginning of my career. But honestly, it doesn't fit for development=)
	

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Work experience

**Rust Core Blockchain Developer** [Supercolony](https://supercolony.net) _(April 2021 - Present)_

The work is related to evolving of the ecosystem and WASM smart contract development. Except for that, 
there was several project of portfolio companies related to ink!, substrate development.
- Successfully ported two big projects from Solidity to ink!(30+ contracts) that increased the coverage of audience.
- Designed and implemented OpenBrush as a first library(analog of OpenZeppelin) to ease out WASM smart contract development experience in the dotsama community.
- Implemented functionality for upgradeable contracts on all execution layers and made it possible in the ecosystem.
- Participated and implemented(some of them) major features in the ink! to improve the language syntax and simplify the development.
- Designed the architecture of substrate-based blockchain with inner yield protocols.
- Decreased the size of smart contracts to improve on-chain performance.
- Designed and implemented standards of Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Multi tokens to unify the interface for the WASM smart contract ecosystem.
- Optimized(x25) the Graph indexer for PancakeSwap to process transactions with the speed of the binance smart chain.
